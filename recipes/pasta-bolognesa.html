    <p>
        This classic Italian-American comfort food works with any kind of sausage, but I like the fennel and anise flavors of sweet Italian sausage with the beans--it's a hearty soup that's fast and easy to put together.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 tablespoon olive oil </li>
        <li> 12 ounces sweet bulk Italian sausage </li>
        <li> 1 stalk celery, diced </li>
        <li> ½ yellow onion, chopped </li>
        <li> ¾ cup dry elbow macaroni </li>
        <li> ¼ cup tomato paste </li>
        <li> 3 cups chicken broth, or more as needed, divided </li>
        <li> Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste </li>
        <li> ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste </li>
        <li> ¼ teaspoon dried oregano </li>
        <li> 3 cups chopped Swiss chard </li>
        <li> 1 (15 ounce) can cannellini (white kidney) beans, drained </li>
        <li> ¼ cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, plus additional for serving, or to taste </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Brown sausage while breaking it into small pieces, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Add diced celery and chopped onion. Cook until onions are translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add dry pasta. Cook and stir 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Stir in tomato paste until evenly distributed, 2 to 3 minutes. Add 3 cups broth. Raise heat to high and bring to a simmer. Add salt, black pepper, pepper flakes, and oregano. When soup comes to a boil, reduce heat to medium and let it simmer about 5 minutes, stirring often. Check soup consistency and add more broth, if needed.
        </li>
        <li>Place chopped chard in a bowl. Cover with cold water and rinse the leaves; any grit will fall to the bottom of the bowl. Transfer chard to colander to drain briefly; add to soup. Cook and stir until leaves wilt, 2 to 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Stir in white beans; continue cooking and stirring until pasta is perfectly cooked, another 4 or 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in grated cheese. Serve topped with grated cheese, if desired.

    </ol>
